# Add Dial Channel

Adds [Dial](https://getdial.ai) — a real phone number for **SMS and AI voice
calls**. Native adapter (no Chat SDK bridge): outbound via the `@getdial/sdk`
client, inbound via Dial's CLI command-target daemon. NanoClaw doesn't ship
channels in trunk — this skill copies the Dial adapter, its pairing helper, and
their tests in from the `channels` branch. The `pair-dial` setup step is
maintained in trunk, so it is not copied here.

The mechanical steps under **Apply** carry `nc:` directive fences: an agent
reads the prose and applies them, and a parser can apply them deterministically
from the same document. Every directive is idempotent, so the whole skill is
safe to re-run; anything a parser can't apply falls back to the prose beside it.

## Apply

### 1. Copy the adapter, pairing helper, tests, and container skill

Fetch the `channels` branch and copy the Dial adapter, its pairing store (with
its test), the registration test, and the `dial-cli` container skill into place
(overwrite — the branch is canonical):

```nc:copy from-branch:channels
src/channels/dial.ts
src/channels/dial-pairing.ts
src/channels/dial-pairing.test.ts
src/channels/dial-registration.test.ts
container/skills/dial-cli/SKILL.md
```

### 2. Register the adapter

Append the self-registration import to the channel barrel (skipped if present).
This one line is the skill's only reach-in into the channel core:

```nc:append to:src/channels/index.ts
import './dial.js';
```

### 3. Register the pairing setup step

Add the `pair-dial` loader to the `STEPS` map in `setup/index.ts`, inside the
dormant marker region (skipped if already present — `pair-dial` ships in core, so
this idempotent-skips on a normal install, but is expressed for a clean-upstream
rebuild). The pairing handshake below spawns this step:

```nc:append to:setup/index.ts at:nanoclaw:setup-steps
'pair-dial': () => import('./pair-dial.js'),
```

### 4. Install the packages

Pinned to exact versions — the supply-chain policy rejects ranges and `latest`.
`@getdial/sdk` is the adapter's outbound client; `qrcode` renders the scannable
pairing card:

```nc:dep
@getdial/sdk@0.17.0
qrcode@1.5.4
```

### 5. Build and validate

Build first: it guards the adapter's typed core calls and proves the dependency
is installed. Then run the one integration test.

```nc:run effect:build
pnpm run build
```
```nc:run effect:test
pnpm exec vitest run src/channels/dial-registration.test.ts
```

`dial-registration.test.ts` imports the real channel barrel and asserts the
registry contains `dial` — it goes red if the import line drifts or `@getdial/sdk`
isn't installed (the import throws). End-to-end SMS/voice is verified manually
once the service runs.

## Sign in to Dial

Dial's CLI owns the account credential (an auth file it writes on sign-in), so
the setup uses the `dial` CLI here. Ensure it's installed — this installs it if
it's missing (for the full onboarding/auth reference, see the `dial-cli` skill or
`curl -fsSL https://getdial.ai/skills.md`):

```nc:run effect:external
command -v dial || curl -fsSL https://getdial.ai/install | bash
```

Check whether you're already signed in:

```nc:run capture:signed_in=.auth.signedIn validate:^(true|false)$ effect:fetch
dial doctor --json
```

If you're **not** signed in, go straight to email verification — default the
choice so the branch guard below stays single-valued:

```nc:run capture:reuse_choice when:signed_in=false effect:external
echo switch
```

If you **are** signed in, read which account (for the prompt below) and ask
whether to reuse it or sign in as a different one (matches the old wizard's
"Reuse this account?" prompt, with an explicit way to switch):

```nc:run capture:connected_email=.auth.email when:signed_in=true effect:fetch
dial doctor --json
```
```nc:operator when:signed_in=true
You're already signed in to Dial as {{connected_email}}.
```
```nc:prompt reuse_choice validate:^(reuse|switch)$ when:signed_in=true
Reuse this Dial account, or sign in as a different one? (reuse/switch)
```

**Reuse** — no verification needed; onboard just (re)installs the NanoClaw agent skill:

```nc:run effect:external when:reuse_choice=reuse
dial onboard --agent nanoclaw
```

**Switch (or not signed in)** — verify an email with a one-time code. Collect the email:

```nc:prompt owner_email validate:^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$ when:reuse_choice=switch
What's your email? Dial sends a one-time code to verify it.
```

Send the code (`--force` re-sends even if a prior code is pending):

```nc:run effect:external when:reuse_choice=switch
dial signup {{owner_email}} --force
```

Collect the code (resolves inline, right after the send above):

```nc:prompt otp validate:^\d{6}$ when:reuse_choice=switch
Enter the 6-digit code from your email
```

Verify it and provision your number (this also installs the NanoClaw agent skill):

```nc:run effect:external when:reuse_choice=switch
dial onboard --code {{otp}} --inbound-instruction "You are a friendly AI receptionist answering calls to this number. Greet the caller, ask how you can help, and take a clear message — their name, number, and reason for calling — if you cannot help directly." --agent nanoclaw
```

Confirm the account's number — this becomes the agent's public line (its
`platform_id`):

```nc:run capture:platform_id validate:^\+[1-9]\d{6,14}$ effect:fetch
dial number list --json | jq -er '.numbers[0].number'
```
```nc:operator
Your agent's public Dial line is {{platform_id}} — anyone who texts or calls it reaches the agent.
```

## Restart

Restart the service so it loads the Dial adapter, and wait for its CLI socket.
The adapter must be live and polling before pairing — it's the thing that
observes the code you text:

```nc:run effect:restart
bash setup/lib/restart.sh
```

Wire inbound event delivery and the command target. Both are best-effort: a
sandbox/CI without a user-service supervisor can't run the `listen` daemon, but
outbound still works and inbound can be started manually later (see
Troubleshooting), so these never fail the run:

```nc:run effect:external
dial listen install || true
```
```nc:run effect:external
dial local-target add cmd "$PWD/data/dial/handle-dial-event.sh" || true
```

## Pair your phone

Dial account auth carries no per-sender binding, so the agent proves you own the
phone you'll text from with a one-time pairing handshake: it issues a 4-digit
code, you text those exact 4 digits to the Dial line, and the live adapter
matches them. Tell the user:

```nc:operator
A 4-digit pairing code (and a scannable QR) is about to appear in this terminal. From the phone you want to use, text just those 4 digits to your Dial line {{platform_id}} — or scan the QR, which opens Messages pre-filled so you just press Send.
```

Run the pairing handshake. It prints the code/QR, streams "waiting…" while it
watches for your text, and resolves the sender's number once the code matches:

```nc:run effect:step capture:owner_handle=PAIRED_NUMBER
pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step pair-dial -- --line {{platform_id}}
```

`owner_handle` (the phone you paired from) and `platform_id` (your Dial line) are
what the owner-wiring step needs. The greeting goes out over your Dial line as
soon as pairing completes.

## Add phone superpowers (optional)

Show the pitch as a boxed note, then ask — mirrors the old wizard's `p.note`
+ confirm:

```nc:operator
Add phone superpowers to your assistant? Say yes so your assistant can send SMS and make AI calls for you from every channel you use it on — Telegram, WhatsApp, and more.
```
```nc:prompt install_tool validate:^(yes|no)$
Install the Dial tool now?
```

If yes, install it (best-effort — this reuses the standalone tool installer, which
needs OneCLI; it prints its own guidance and never fails the run if OneCLI isn't
set up yet):

```nc:run effect:external when:install_tool=yes
bash .claude/skills/add-dial-tool/add.sh || true
```

## Next Steps

If you're in the middle of `/setup`, return to the setup flow now. Otherwise wire
this channel with `/init-first-agent` (or `/manage-channels`). To add a second
Dial number later, see the `/add-dial-number` skill.

## Channel Info

- **type**: `dial`
- **terminology**: Dial calls it a "number" or "line." One number is a single public, threaded line — each texter/caller gets their own thread.
- **platform-id-format**: the bare E.164 number (e.g. `+14155550123`) — unlike prefixed channels, the number itself is the id.
- **how-to-find-id**: Do NOT ask the user for an id. Dial registration uses pairing — run `pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step pair-dial -- --line <E.164>`. The step prints a 4-digit code + QR; tell the user to text just those 4 digits to the Dial line. Success emits a `PAIR_DIAL` block with `STATUS=success`, `PLATFORM_ID` (the bare line), and `PAIRED_NUMBER` (the bare sender E.164). The service must be running — the adapter is what observes the code.
- **supports-threads**: yes (each correspondent is a thread on the one public line)
- **typical-use**: A real phone number for SMS and AI-handled voice calls — receptionist, notifications, 2FA relay.
- **default-isolation**: One public line → one agent group; anyone who texts/calls it reaches that agent.

## Troubleshooting

**`dial: command not found` / the CLI gate fails.** The Dial CLI isn't on PATH. Run `curl -fsSL https://getdial.ai/skills.md` and follow its install steps, then re-run this step.

**The email code never arrives.** Check spam, confirm the address is one you can read, and re-run — `dial signup <email>` re-sends. The code is sent by Dial's servers, not NanoClaw.

**Inbound texts/calls don't reach the agent.** `dial listen install` needs a user-service supervisor (launchd/systemd `--user`); sandboxes/CI don't have one. Outbound still works. Start it manually with `dial listen install` once a supervisor is available, and confirm the command target with `dial local-target list`.

**Pairing never completes.** The live adapter observes the code, so the service must be running — the restart step comes before pairing for exactly this reason. Text *just* the 4 digits to the Dial line; a wrong message is ignored. If it times out (5 min), re-run this step for a fresh code.

**Everything green but no replies.** Run `pnpm exec vitest run src/channels/dial-registration.test.ts` — red means the barrel import or the `@getdial/sdk` install drifted, so re-run the Apply steps. If green, restart again (`bash setup/lib/restart.sh`) and check `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`.
